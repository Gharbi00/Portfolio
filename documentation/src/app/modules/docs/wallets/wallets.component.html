  <h2>Wallet Settings Page</h2>
  <div id="introduction">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The Wallet Settings page allows customers to configure their coins and points. Here, you can set up two types of
      points to reward consumer actions: quantitative (monetary value) and qualitative
      (status and levels value). You can access this page in the Elevok Marketplace under the Customer Engagement app,
      specifically in the Wallets tab.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="config">
    <h3>Configuring Points</h3>
    <ul class="list-item-one">
      <li>Quantitative Points (Monetary Value): Select the type of quantitative points you want to use for rewarding
        actions. These points have a direct monetary value.</li>
      <li>Qualitative Points (Status and Levels Value): Enable the qualitative points to reward actions based on status
        and levels and choose an avatar to represent the qualitative points.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="manage">
    <h3>Creating and Managing Coins</h3>
    <p>You have two options for managing coins in your wallet, you either create your own coin or use one of our
      aggregators</p>
  </div>
  <div id="own">
    <h3>Creating Your Own Coin</h3>
    <p>Create a custom coin by following these steps:</p>
    <ul class="list-item-one">
      <li>Upload an avatar for the coin.</li>
      <li>Choose a picture that represents the coin.</li>
      <li>Define the value of the coin in fiat currency.</li>
      <li>Save the coin configuration. This custom coin will now be available for rewarding consumer actions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="aggregator">
    <h3>Using Aggregator Coins</h3>
    <p>If you prefer not to create your own coin, you can select from one of our aggregators in the dropdown menu. This
      option allows you to:</p>
    <ul class="list-item-one">
      <li>Use an existing coin from the aggregator for rewarding quantitative points.</li>
      <li>Configure settings according to the selected aggregator's specifications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With this setup, you will maintain your custom levels for qualitative points while using the aggregatorâ€™s coin
      for
      quantitative rewards.</p>
    <p>By configuring your wallet settings, you can tailor the reward system to fit your business needs and enhance
      customer engagement effectively. For more detailed guidance on each option, please
      refer to the Elevok Help Center.</p>
