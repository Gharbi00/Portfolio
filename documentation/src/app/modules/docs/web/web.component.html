    <h3>Embedding the Widget</h3>
    <p>To showcase the Elevok Player Widget on your website or web application, you'll need to insert a JavaScript code
      snippet into the relevant section of your webpage. Here's how:</p>
    <ul class="list-item-one">
      <li>Copy the Code Snippet: Grab the JavaScript code snippet provided below.</li>
      <pre class="bg-black"><code><span class="s1">&lt;!-- index.html --&gt;</span>
  
  <span class="s1">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
  <span class="s2">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="s2">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="s2">// Your head content ........</span>
  <span class="s2"></span>
    <span class="s2">&lt;script src="<span class="s3">https://widget.elevok.com/sdk.js</span>" defer=<span class="s3">"defer"</span>&gt;</span><span class="s2">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span class="s2">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="s2">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="s2">// Your body content ........</span>
  <span class="s2"></span>
    <span class="s2">&lt;script&gt; window.widgetInit = &lbrace; appId: 'Your_Client_Key', locale: 'en', theme: 'light' &rbrace;;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span class="s2">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
  <span class="s2">&lt;/html&gt;</span></code>
    </pre>
      <li>Paste the Snippet: Insert the code snippet just before the closing body and the head tag in the HTML of your
        webpage. If you're utilizing dynamic page generation technologies such as PHP or ASP, include the snippet in the
        header file that is incorporated in each page.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="modes">
    <h3>Widget Modes </h3>
    <p>The Elevok Player Widget supports two modes: guest view and player view, serving distinct purposes while
      utilizing
      the same code snippet.</p>
    <ul class="list-item-one">
      <li>Guest View: Ideal for non-logged-in users to explore your loyalty program and encourage registration.</li>
      <li>Player View: Tailored for logged-in users to track their progress and enjoy program benefits.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="config">
    <h3>Guest View Configuration</h3>
    <p>For non-logged-in users, utilize the following snippet and replace 'Your_API_Key' with your unique API Key
      obtained
      from Elevok.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/doc/img_01.png" alt="" class="img-meta">
  </div>
  <div id="setup">
    <h3>Player View Setup</h3>
    <p>To switch to player mode, execute the Elevok Consumer Login API during user login or registration in your main
      application. This API notifies the widget about the new user, enabling seamless transitions between guest and
      player
      views.</p>
    <div class="mark-blue">
      Upon initializing the widget with player data, Elevok's player profile undergoes creation or updating on the
      backend. To enrich your Elevok player profile with attributes not directly accessible via the user interface, send
      the dta you need via the Player Login API.
    </div>

    <div class="mark-red">
      Selecting an Immutable Player Unique ID
      The Elevok user profile is established utilizing the playerUniqueId. It's imperative to opt for a unique
      identifier
      that remains constant and is never altered. Should this identifier change for a particular player, there's a
      significant risk of forfeiting all original data associated with that player, including accrued points and rewards
      within Elevok. Thus, it's strongly advised against utilizing mutable identifiers such as email addresses or mobile
      numbers, as they are subject to change by the user at any given time.
